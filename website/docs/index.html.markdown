# FortiOS Provider

The FortiOS provider is used to interact with the resources supported by FortiOS. We need to configure the provider with with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the FortiOS Provider
provider "fortios" {
	hostname = "54.226.179.231"
	token = "jn3t3Nw7qckQzt955Htkfj5hwQ6jdb"	
}

# Create a Static Route Item
resource "fortios_networking_route_static" "test1" {
	dst = "110.2.2.122/32"
	gateway = "2.2.2.2"
	# ...
}
```

## Authentication

The FortiOS provider offers a means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

### Static credentials
Static credentials can be provided by adding a `token` key in-line in the FortiOS provider block.

Usage:
```hcl
provider "fortios" {
	hostname = "54.226.179.231"
	token = "jn3t3Nw7qckQzt955Htkfj5hwQ6jdb"	
}
```
### Environment variables 
You can provide your credentials via the `FORTIOS_ACCESS_HOSTNAME` and `FORTIOS_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variables. Note that setting your FortiOS credentials using static credentials variables will override the environment variables. 

Usage:

```hcl
$ export FORTIOS_ACCESS_HOSTNAME=192.168.52.177
$ export FORTIOS_ACCESS_TOKEN=q3Hs49jxts195gkd9Hjsxnjtmr6k39
```

Then configure the FortiOS Provider as following:
```hcl
provider "fortios" { }

# Create a Static Route Item
resource "fortios_networking_route_static" "test1" {
	dst = "110.2.2.122/32"
	gateway = "2.2.2.2"
	blackhole = "disable"
	distance = "22"
	weight = "3"
	# â€¦
}
```
## VDOM
If the FortiGate unit is running in VDOM mode, the `vdom` configuration needs to be added.

Usage:
```hcl
provider "fortios" {
	hostname = "192.168.52.177"
	token = "q3Hs49jxts195gkd9Hjsxnjtmr6k39"
	vdom = "vdomtest"
}

resource "fortios_networking_route_static" "test1" {
	dst = "120.2.2.122/32"
	gateway = "2.2.2.2"
	blackhole = "disable"
	distance = "22"
	weight = "3"
	priority = "3"
	device = "lbforvdomtest"
	comment = "Terraform test"
}
```
